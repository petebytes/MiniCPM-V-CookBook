# MiniCPM-o 4.5 — Overview

The omni-modal flagship of the MiniCPM-o series — vision, speech, and full-duplex live streaming, all in a single model.

## Highlights

- **End-to-end omnimodal** — vision encoder + speech encoder + LLM + TTS densely connected via hidden states
- **Full-duplex live streaming** — hear, see, and speak simultaneously
- **Voice cloning** and configurable assistant voice

For real-time, full-duplex demos see the [MiniCPM-o-Demo](https://github.com/OpenBMB/MiniCPM-o-Demo) repository — it ships a turn-key web demo for the o-series with PyTorch + CUDA inference and a frontend.
